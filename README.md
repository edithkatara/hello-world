The learning continues
I was working in Finance for the past 8 years, of which I resigned once I decided to follow my passion. my career aspiration is to become successful in Data Science, I am willing to work my way up from the bottom up. I am very committed to learning as much as I can in this short period of time. I can and will do this.
